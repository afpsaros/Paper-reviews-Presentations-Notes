\section{Probabilistic calibration}
Consider input-output random variables following a distribution $X, Y \sim \mathbb{P}$ and $T$ i.i.d. realizations $\{x_t, y_t\}_{t=1}^T$. 
The true data-generating process is defined by $G_t(y) = P(Y_t \leq y)$ for every $t$.
Consider also a probabilistic model $H$ which accepts $x_t$ as input and outputs a CDF $F_t(y)$. 
The model is probabilistically calibrated if
\begin{equation}\label{prob_calib}
	\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}G_t\circ F_t^{-1}(p)\to p
\end{equation}
for all $p\in(0,1)$ and for $T \to \infty$.
Eq.~\eqref{prob_calib} is equivalent to
\begin{equation}\label{prob_calib_2}
\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}P(Y_t \leq F_t^{-1}(p))\to p
\end{equation}
and to 
\begin{equation}\label{prob}
P(Y \leq F_X^{-1}(p)) =  p
\end{equation}
Also, because $T \to \infty$
\begin{equation}\label{prob_calib_3}
\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\boldsymbol{1}(y_t \leq F_t^{-1}(p))\to p
\end{equation}
where the random variable $Y_t$ has been replaced by the realization $y_t$. 
Eq.~\eqref{prob_calib_3} can also be written as
\begin{equation}\label{prob_calib_4}
\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\boldsymbol{1}(F_t(y_t) \leq p)\to p
\end{equation}

\section{Theoretical recalibration}
Suppose that the model is miscalibrated and $P(Y \leq F_X^{-1}(p))$ in Eq.~\eqref{prob} is not equal to $p$, but to some $Q(p)$, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
	Q(p) = P(Y \leq F_X^{-1}(p)) \neq p
\end{equation}
Then consider $p = Q^{-1}(p')$ for arbitrary $p' \in (0,1)$ and 
\begin{equation}
p' = Q\circ Q^{-1}(p') = P(Y \leq F_X^{-1}\circ Q^{-1}(p') )
\end{equation}
Then by using the property $(g \circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}$
\begin{equation}
p' = P(Y \leq (Q\circ F_X)^{-1}(p') )
\end{equation}
Therefore, $Q\circ F_X$ yields a perfectly calibrated model. 
In other words, for recalibrating our model we train an auxiliary model $R$ that approximates $Q$.
Then we apply $R$ to any output CDF from our model. 

\section{Approximate recalibration}
Given the realizations $\{x_t, y_t\}_{t=1}^T$ and the CDFs $F_t(y)$ for every $t$, we can construct an estimate of $Q(p)$ as
\begin{equation}
Q_T(p) = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\boldsymbol{1}(F_t(y_t) \leq p)
\end{equation}
The aim of recalibration is to fit an auxiliary model $R$ to the estimate $Q_T(p)$.

What is the training data? 
How can we combine the realizations and the CDFs in order to obtain useful data for training $R$? 
The input should be some confidence level $p_t$ and the output should be $Q_T(p_t)$. 
Our training set is therefore
\begin{equation}
	\cD_R = \left\{p_t = F_t(y_t), Q_T(p_t)\right\}
\end{equation}
where, for clarity, 
\begin{equation}
Q_T(p_t) = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t'=1}^{T}\boldsymbol{1}(F_t'(y_t') \leq p_t)
\end{equation}
We can use an isotonic regression model for $R$.
See Fig.~\ref{fig:isotonic} for an example of isotonic regression in a context other than recalibration. 
See also Fig.~\ref{fig:recalib_reg} for a recalibration example from \textcite{kuleshov2018accurate}.
